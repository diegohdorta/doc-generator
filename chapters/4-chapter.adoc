== RB HandWritten Digit Application

_Robin Bird&#8482;_ has a _Neural Network_ implemented for _handwritten digits recognition_ and
instead of explaining the code itself, the document focuses more on the how to get started with this application.
The steps consist on:

* _Collecting the data_ <<collect>>;
* _Training and testing the data_ <<training>>, _and then_;
* _Running inference on a new input data_ <<inference>>.

[[collect]]
=== RB Webpage for Data Collect

To download a _handwritten digit_ model, use the internal http://10.29.244.105/robinbird/index.html[_Robin Bird&#8482;_] webpage.
This page was create to collect data for training the model, to help the user only need to write
the random number that is sorted on the white space and then, click send. 

[CAUTION]
====
This step is **NOT** required. Skip it and go direct to <<inference>> section. 
====

[TIP]
====
The http://10.29.244.105/robinbird/index.html[_Robin Bird&#8482;_] webpage has model to download and avoid spending time on training.
====

. Follow a screenshot of the webpage where should be draw the random numbers:

[TIP]
====
The http://10.29.244.105/robinbird/index.html[_Robin Bird&#8482;_] webpage trains model every _100_ new inputs.

[[training]]
=== RB Training and Testing

The http://10.29.244.105/robinbird/index.html[_Robin Bird&#8482;_] webpage provides the model and also the _dataset_ for training on any device that has the library installed.

[TIP]
====
To download the model and using it, go to <<inference>> section.
====

The following instructions explain how to get a dataset, how the _dataset_ works and how to train the model
on a <<train_pc>> or <<train_imx>>.

==== RB Model Format

_Robin Bird&#8482;_ has a different format to save the data, the images collected in the http://10.29.244.105/robinbird/index.html[_Robin Bird&#8482;_] webpage are convert to _gray scale_,
then all the _black spots_ receive _ones_ and the _white spots_ receive _zero_, as follows:

.Dataset Example
image::chapters/media/sample_1.png[alt=.Dataset Example, pdfwidth=20%, title-align=center, align=center]

[TIP]
====
The images used in this dataset have _32x32_ (1024 pixels).
====

[[train_pc]]
==== Training on Host GNU/Linux PC

Using the _dataset_ containing the binary images it is possible to start computing the model.

. Download the dataset for training and for testing from http://10.29.244.105/robinbird/index.html[_Robin Bird&#8482;_] webpage:
