== Introduction

It is not easy to chart the rise of _Linux_ without risking the appearance of
exaggeration and hyperbole. _Linux_ has grown alone in the past few years from
a simple software to an upstart challenger in the market to a well-respected
system taking its rightful place in educational and corporate networks. _Linux_
is the world's most widespread operating system and its trajectory has just
begun. Linus was developed by _Linus Torvalds_ at the University of Helsinki in
Finland. Linus continues to centrally coordinate improvements from his current
location at Silicon Valley. Several programmers all over the world, from a new
graduating student to major computer programmers connected through the Internet
continue to developed the _Linux Kernel_.

By "_Kernel_", we mean the core of the operating system itself, not the
applications that run on it, such as the compiler, shells and so forth. The term
"_Linux_ " is often used to mean a software environment with a _Linux Kernel_,
along with a large set of applications and other software components. The right
term would be "_GNU/Linux_", which acknowledges the central role played by tools
from the _**Free Software Fundation's GNU**_ project as complements to the
developmet of the _Linux Kernel_. _Linux_ system cannot be technically referred
to as a "version of _Unix_", as they have not undergone the required tests and
licensing. Before an operating sytem can be called "_Unix_", it must be branded
by _The Open Group_. _Linux_ offers all the common programming interfaces of
standard _Unix_ systems along with _Unix_ utilities that have been reimplemented
on _Linux_. It is powerful, robust, fully usable system.

The historical impact of _Linux_ goes beyond its role as a challenge to all
versions of _Unix_ as well as _Microsoft Windows_, particularly on servers.
_Linux's_ success has also inspired countless other free software or open source
projects, including _Samba_, _GNOME_, and a mind-boggling collection of
innovative projects that you can browse at numerous sites. As both a platform
for other developers and a development model, _Linux_ gave a tremendous boost to
the _GNU project_ and jas also become a popular platform for Java development.
In short, _Linux_ is a focal point in the most exciting and productive
free-software movement ever seen.

=== Generic Architecture of an Embedded Linux System

=== Standalone Setup

=== Solid State Storage Media (SD Card)

The NXP standard solid state storage device holds the initial _bootloader_, its
configuration parameters, the _Kernel_, and the root filesystem. Though the
development of an embedded _GNU/Linux_ system may use other boot setups,
depending on the development stage, most production systems contaid a solid
state storage media to hold all the system's components. The following figure
shows the most common layout of a solid state storage device with all the
system components.
